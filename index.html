            <strong>Padel</strong> is a racket sport typically played in doubles
            on an enclosed court slightly smaller than a doubles tennis court.
            Scoring is the same as normal tennis, and the balls used are similar
            but with a little less pressure. The main differences are that the
            court has walls and the balls can be played off them in a similar
            way as in the game of squash and that solid, stringless bats are
            used. The height of the ball being served must be at or below the
            waist level. Padel is different from the sport known in Canada and
            the United States as paddle tennis. It is also not to be confused
            with platform tennis, a winter and summer sport typically played at
            country clubs in Canada and the US, with courts heated from below to
            eliminate snow and water. The court, rules, and styles of play are
            very different.

        <strong>I</strong> started playing padel in 2018. I have no background
        in racket spors so I was a total beginner but I loved it from the start!
        It turned out that I am really good at it. I quickly climbed the padel
        ladder and won a lot of tournaments.I joined a liga (picture) and we
        compete against other clund all around the region of Malaga. This is a
        wonderful way to have a great time with friends and learn more things
        aboutthe game, while competing. In may 2022 I hurt myself and had to
        rest for almost four month. It took a toll on me but I am finally back!
        i will continue to play as long as my body allows me to.
