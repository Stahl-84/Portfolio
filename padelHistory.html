            <strong>Padel-Tennis</strong>, also known as Padel or Paddle, has
            its origins on a not so popular variant of enclosed Tennis called
            Platform Tennis. Enrique Corcuera in 1969 decided to adapt his
            Squash court at his home in Acapulco (Mexico) with elements of
            Platform Tennis creating what he called "Paddle Corcuera". He is
            considered the inventor of Padel. <br /><br />
            Enrique's Spanish friend Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg tried this
            new invention at Enrique's home and instantly felt in love.
            Immediately after, he decided to create the first two Padel courts
            in a Tennis club in Marbella (Spain), this was 1974. Nevertheless
            Alfonso included few modifications from Enrique's original designs
            to make it more competitive, being this the first of many iterations
            Padel will have in the following 20 years in Spain. In the meantime
            in 1975, Julio Menditeguy an Argentinian member of Alfonso's Tennis
            club in Marbella felt the same passion and decided to import the
            sport to Argentina. <br /><br />
            Since the first courts in Spain, Padel took nearly 25 years to be
            extended all over the Spanish geography. Finally in the early 2000s
            there were more than 500 Padel clubs and many Spanish hotels already
            included as sport activity Padel Courts. In 2005 Padel was already
            well-established in Spain with more than 1000 Clubs. It is when the
            most important Padel Associations decided together to establish an
            International Championship played fully in Spain. This was the
            beginning of Padel Pro Tour, which lasted until 2012. Specially
            since 2010 this sport has been constantly growing and blossoming all
            over the world and it is now for many people considered the fastest
            growing sport around the world as you can read in this article from
            the British newspaper The Telegraph...
